== TL;DR

An input file with all rows of the format `<station name>;<temperature>` is
given. It contains a billion rows (1,000,000,000 = 10\^9). Station names may
repeat.

Output a file of the format `<station name>;min;max;mean` sorted by the station
name.

== Goal

Currently this is a learning exercise for myself. I am learning golang and doing
some excessive yakshaving to fill gaps in my knowledge and exploring topics that
I want to.

The original 1brc repo is a mess and the generator especially is. You should be
able to do `go run github.com/ellipse0934/1BRC/cmd/generate --rows=1000000000
--station-set=extended` to make your own `input.txt` file.

I will be exploring some golang topics like unit testing, benchmarking using
pprof, RNG, concurrency and parallelisation, etc. Wherever my mind takes me. I'll be
happy with a sub 10 second solution. But there is no solution as of now.
